# 🛠️ Contributing to Neuro-Existential Engineering (NE-E)

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to the NE-E framework. By contributing, you are helping to build a **de-mystified, open-source infrastructure** for human cognitive governance.

We don't want "disciples"; we want **Architects** who can test, break, and refine the code of human experience.

## 🏗️ Our Core Philosophy: "Eat Your Own Dog Food"

Before submitting a patch or a protocol, you must adhere to the **Architect’s Vow**:

> _“I shall not submit a protocol that I have not personally verified to produce a measurable reduction in surprisal or a visible return to steady state.”_

We value **first-person empirical data** combined with **third-person neuroscientific logic.**

## 📂 Contribution Tiers

We are looking for contributions in the following three areas:

### 1. Theoretical Patches (The Kernel)

Refining the relationship between the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** and existential experience.

- **Focus:** Improving the mathematical or neurological descriptions of "The Self" or "Ground State."
    
- **Requirement:** Cite peer-reviewed neuroscience or reputable analytical philosophy.
    

### 2. Physical Hacks (The Hardware Layer)

Discovering new **physical anchors** that interrupt limbic avalanches.

- **Example:** The _Palate Protocol_ (using the release of the upper palate to break tension).
    
- **Focus:** Tongue positioning, eye-movement patterns, breathing interrupts, or specific muscle-chain releases.
    

### 3. Case Studies & Stress Tests (The Debugger)

Providing anonymized "Black Box" reports of the framework in extreme environments.

- **Focus:** How did `[Emergency-Bypass]` perform during a high-stakes social conflict? What caused the system to crash?

## 📝 Submission Guidelines

### How to Submit a "Physical Hack"

When submitting a new physical intercept, please use the following template in your Pull Request:

- **Protocol Name:** (e.g., The "Gaze-Shift" Protocol)
    
- **Target Node:** (Which muscle group or sensory input?)
    
- **Mechanism:** (Why does this work neurologically?)
    
- **Execution SOP:** (Step-by-step instructions)
    
- **Verification:** (What is the subjective/objective delta after execution?)
    

### Documentation & Translation

While **English** is our primary language for global technical alignment, we welcome translations that maintain strict technical precision. Avoid using religious or "New Age" terminology.

## 🚫 The "Anti-Guru" Policy

To maintain the integrity of NE-E as a scientific engineering project:

1. **No Mysticism:** If you can’t describe a state without using "energy," "vibrations," or "destiny," it doesn’t belong in the core repo.
    
2. **No Deification:** Do not credit "masters" or "deities." Credit the **architecture of the nervous system.**
    
3. **No Moralizing:** We treat "suffering" as a **system error** or **computational waste**, not a moral failing or a sin.
