# NE-E Glossary of Terms v2.0

This document defines the technical lexicon for **Neuro-Existential Engineering (NE-E)**. It maps subjective cognitive experiences to **Predictive Processing (PP)** and **System Engineering** concepts.

## I. Core Theoretical Constants

|**Term**|**Technical Mapping**|**NE-E Definition**|
|---|---|---|
|**Surprisal (惊奇值)**|**Prediction Error / Entropy**|The delta between internal models and sensory input. High surprisal = High cognitive load = Suffering.|
|**Precision Weighting ($\pi$)**|**Signal Gain / Reliability**|The "volume control" the brain assigns to a signal. NE-E focuses on withdrawing $\pi$ from narrative "noise."|
|**Computational Dividend**|**Recovered Bandwidth**|The neural energy reclaimed by shutting down redundant [F-Tier] processes.|
|**Steady State**|**Homeostasis**|A state where prediction errors are resolved with minimal friction, maintaining system balance.|

## II. [F-Tiers] (Fabrication Tiers) - The Diagnostic Bugs

_These tiers represent the levels of redundant "work" the brain performs to maintain a persistent self-model._

- **[F-1] Narrative Fabrication:** The semantic layer where the brain constructs a story to explain raw signals (e.g., "They are ignoring me on purpose").
    
- **[F-2] Identity Fabrication:** The overfitting layer where signals are forcefully attached to a persistent "Self" label (e.g., "I am unlovable").
    
- **[F-3] Existential Fabrication:** The basal idle layer where the system expends energy solely to simulate the continuity and "solidity" of the observer.

## III. [E-Stages] (Evolution Stages) - The System Patches

_The roadmap for transitioning from an overfitted system to a high-efficiency probabilistic engine._

- **[E-1] Tooling (Cooling):** The phase of **Damage Control**. Uses physical interrupts (Palate Protocol) to reduce narrative heat.
    
- **[E-2] Deconstruction (Transparency):** The phase of **Structural Dissolution**. Signals are no longer blocked by "identity"; they become transparent to the system.
    
- **[E-3] Essence (Fluidity):** The phase of **Probabilistic Awareness**. The system operates as a zero-friction Bayesian engine, moving with pure data flow.

## IV. Operational Protocols

- **Palate Protocol:** A hardware-level interrupt. Forcing the release of the upper palate to send a "Safety" signal via the trigeminal/vagal nerves, breaking the physical loop of [F-1].
    
- **[V-3-S] Triple Jump:** A software-level rectification sequence:
    
    1. **Vajra (Intercept):** Flagging a signal as "Fabrication."
        
    2. **Void (De-weight):** Setting $\pi \to 0$ for the narrative.
        
    3. **Steady (Ground):** Re-anchoring to raw sensory 真值 (True Value).
        
- **[E-B] Emergency Bypass:** A fail-safe mode triggered during total [F-1] breach (rage/panic). It suspends all semantic processing to prioritize cooling.

## V. Performance & State Metrics

- **B-GS (Brain Ground State):** The "Zero-G" of the nervous system. A state of deep recovery where the system maps its own existence without narrative interference.
    
- **DRA (Decay Rate of Affect):** The primary KPI. Measures how many seconds/minutes it takes for the system to return to S-0 after a high-surprisal event.
    
- **S-0 to S-5 (State Codes):**
    
    - **S-0:** Zero-friction baseline.
        
    - **S-3:** Detection of [F-Tier] oscillation (Needs intervention).
        
    - **S-5:** System Crash (Requires [E-B]).
